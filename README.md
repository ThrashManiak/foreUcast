# foreUcast
foreUcast is a php website that uses lineal multivariant regressions to forecast countries happines. 
It will allow you to play with the coeficients in the equation but so far the regresion is not 'real' because it does not calculate all the parameters and there is information only for 12 countries, but as soon as I get some spare time, if I did not already forgot my PhP I'll be back to it
